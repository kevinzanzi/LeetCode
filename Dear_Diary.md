### kids_with_candies

For the first time I started a problem using Rust instead of being the last one.\
I noticed that I solved it very fast which is strange, but stranger is the fact that this is the first time I have no compiling errors in Rust.\
Additionally, when I created the file in C++, I wondered "how do you get the max value from a std::vector<T>?"; Am I starting to get a little _rusty_? Should I consider myself a _Rust expert_ now? What a strange event this was.

I am not actually fond of list comprehensions but I wanted to highlight that not always the return type matches what's described, and this allowed me to do so.
